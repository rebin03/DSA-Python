## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my work on Data Structures and Algorithms using Python. The goal is to keep improving my problem-solving skills and keep a record of solutions to various DSA problems that I encounter during coding practice.

## Algorithms

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of common sorting techniques such as:
   - Bubble Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Quick Sort
   - Heap Sort

2. **Searching Algorithms**:
   - Linear Search
   - Binary Search

3. **Graph Algorithms**:
   - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
   - DFS (Depth-First Search)
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm
   - Kruskal's Algorithm

4. **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to problems involving dynamic programming techniques.

5. **Greedy Algorithms**: Implementations of problems solved using the greedy method.

6. **Backtracking**: Examples of backtracking problems like N-Queens, and others.

## Data Structures

1. **Arrays**: Various problems and solutions using arrays.
2. **Linked Lists**: Implementations of singly and doubly linked lists, and related problems.
3. **Stacks and Queues**: Implementations of these data structures and related problems.
4. **Trees and Binary Trees**: Tree traversals, BST operations, and more.
5. **Heaps**: Max heap and min heap implementations.
6. **Hashing**: Problems related to hash maps and hash sets.
